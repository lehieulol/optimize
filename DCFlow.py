'''
Idea:
We can check if each judge take at most A then every paper have K judge (1) by this idea:
    Make a directed graph:
    sink -- K --> N paper -- 1 --> M judge -- A --> source
    If max flow of this equal N*K then (1) is true
    
if with A_0, (1) is true; with A >= A_0 (1) is true
if with A_0, (1) is false; with A <= A_0 (1) is false
with this we have a binary patern of (1) 000...00[1]1...111

We want to find minimun A so that (1) is true
Using divide and conquer we can achive that
With A_min found, using dinic algorigthm we can found exactly what edge from N papers to M judges chosen
