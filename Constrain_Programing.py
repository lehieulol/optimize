# ===============================[ Problem ]=============================
# There are vA scientists who need to work on vB papers.
# Each paper requires (at least) vC scientists.
# An array vD of length vB will specify which scientist can work on which paper.
# Goal: Minimize the number of papers each scientist works on.
# ===============================[ Model 1 ]=============================
# Vars:
#  vX[s, p] == 1 means whether Scientist s works on Paper p
#  Domain(vX[s, p]) === (0, 1)
# Constrains:
#  sum(vX[s, p] foreach Scientist s) >= vC foreach Paper p
#  vX[ vD[p, i], p ] == 0 foreach Paper p and i in vD[p]
#   // A scientist can NOT work on this paper
# Objective:
#  Minimize max( sum(vX[s, p] foreach Paper p) foreach Scientist s )
